Current best estimates for DEM parameters:

Kinetic dKn = 3.247441e+18 kg/s^2 = 4.118569e+01 M_Sun/(yr/2pi)^2 (recommended)
Static dKn  = 1.999306e+16 kg/s^2 = 2.535621e-01 M_Sun/(yr/2pi)^2
Cohesion dKn  = 0.000000e+00 kg/s^2 = 0.000000e+00 M_Sun/(yr/2pi)^2
dDelta (for recommended dKn) = 8.260008e-03 s = 1.644601e-09 yr/2pi
dCohesiveCoeff = 0.000000e+00 Pa = 0.000000e+00 M_Sun/AU/(yr/2pi)^2
